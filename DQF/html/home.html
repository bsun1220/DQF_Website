          Mission Statement
        </h1>
        <p class = "text">
          DQF’s mission is to foster a tight-knit community of students and friends passionate about going into quantitative finance. We not only equip Duke undergraduates with the basics of financial mathematics, statistics, and finance but also provide a fun and lively environment. With our organization, we hope to put Duke University on the map for quant recruiting, from trading positions to quantitative research in countless firms.

          Background Information
        </h1>
        <p class = "text">
          DQF was founded in November 2021 by 3 ambitious freshmen students. Since then, over 8 experienced senior quant interns working in places ranging from Jane Street to Optiver have joined forces in educating the Duke Community about quantitative finance. We also work with several of Duke’s academic faculty including Prof. Xavier Mela and Dr. David Ye.

        <p class = "text">
          We had over 60 students attend our rush process! Of which, we accepted 30 students into our education bootcamp. Those who join our club get exclusive access towards competing at national-level trading competitions (from UChicago to UCBerkeley), participation in semester-long projects, and the interview preparatory sessions.
